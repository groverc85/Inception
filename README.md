# Inception

Developed a mission guided maze game inspired by the movie “Inception”. Player will be inside a mansion, searching for keys that can unlock important doors and lead to finale. Unity is adopted as game engine, Kinect can be used as control source.

Think back about Movie "Inception" if you have no clue about how to deal with each door.
